# 01 - Creating a Transaction

The goal of this second round is to try and create a code sample that illustrates a developer should instantiate an `Account` object with the new Web Client SDKs. 

The developer will need to:

- Setup an `Account` class to access an account's assets and resources.
- Be able to easily access the user's assets and resources data.
