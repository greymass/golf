# Code Golf

This repository is meant for brainstorming techniques to utilize [Antelope](https://antelope.io/) based blockchains in applications. 

Each "round" will have a specific README with specific goals, and the objective is to try to determine the best way to achieve that goal.

### To participate

To participate, clone/fork the repository and suggest changes that would improve the readability and functionality of the code. Then submit a pull request to this repository, and leave comments to describe the reason the changes you made are beneficial.

An example PR for the first round: https://github.com/greymass/golf/pull/1

Note that both the commit messages and comments in the PR were left to spur discussion on why these changes may be beneficial or needed.
